      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> December 2025</p>

      <p>
        Streets OS (“we”, “our”, or “us”) operates the website https://streetsos.com and related services
        (the “Service”).
      </p>

      <p>
        This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect information when users interact
        with Streets OS, including when connecting third-party platforms such as TikTok.
      </p>

      <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
      <p>
        When users authenticate with TikTok, we may receive basic profile information and content
        permissions as authorized by the user through TikTok’s Login Kit and Content Posting API.
      </p>

      <h2>How We Use Information</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>To authenticate users</li>
        <li>To publish or schedule content to TikTok on the user’s behalf</li>
        <li>To operate and improve our services</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
      <p>
        Streets OS integrates with TikTok APIs. We do not sell user data and only access data
        explicitly permitted by the user during authorization.
      </p>

      <h2>Data Security</h2>
      <p>
        We take reasonable measures to protect user information and restrict access to authorized
        systems only.
      </p>

      <h2>Contact</h2>
